## Decisions

### AD-001
- **Decision**: Manage all work through the `tlc-spec-driven` skill and the `.specs/` tree (upgraded to v3.3.0 on 2026-10-11).
- **Reason**: Project resumed after a gap; wanted structure and traceability that weren't used at the start.
- **Trade-off**: Upfront documentation effort before feature code.
- **Scope**: All features, both apps.
- **Date**: 2026-07-05
- **Status**: active

### AD-002
- **Decision**: Recurring/installment commitments generate concrete future `FinancialTransaction` rows sharing a `seriesId` — no statistical forecast or projection math; the existing dashboard shows the look-ahead for free.
- **Reason**: The user wants "expense X, 12 parcels" to become 12 real transactions; simpler, explainable, dashboard-compatible.
- **Trade-off**: One-off/variable spending is never anticipated; bulk rows instead of a computed view.
- **Scope**: Recurrence, dashboard. (v1's "must have an end date" was later relaxed by recurrence-model-v2's rolling 12-month window for open-ended RECURRING series.)
- **Date**: 2026-07-05
- **Status**: active

### AD-003
- **Decision**: An installment can be registered mid-way via total `N` + current parcel `k`; the generator produces parcels `k..N`, labelled `k/N`, starting at parcel `k`'s month; the implied end is shown read-only.
- **Reason**: The generator always assumed parcel 1, mislabelling or double-counting purchases already partly imported from the Nubank CSV.
- **Trade-off**: No automatic dedup against CSV imports — the user picks `k`.
- **Scope**: Installment series (backend generator, frontend form).
- **Date**: 2026-07-11
- **Status**: active

### AD-004
- **Decision**: Sharing is modelled as **Shared Plans** — a `Plan` owns transactions and categories; users join via `PlanMembership` with a role (OWNER/EDITOR/CONTRIBUTOR/VIEWER); access is two-layer (plan role × row ownership via `created_by`). Every user gets an auto-created, shareable default plan.
- **Reason**: "Share like a spreadsheet" with partial rights; a household model can't express read-only or own-rows-only.
- **Trade-off**: More entities and an authorization layer; required adopting Flyway for the destructive re-scope.
- **Scope**: All plan-scoped data (transactions, categories, dashboard), authorization.
- **Date**: 2026-07-11
- **Status**: active

### AD-005
- **Decision**: Plan-scoped requests carry the plan as a path variable (`/plan/{planId}/...`), resolved into a `PlanContext` that verifies membership; the plan stays out of the JWT.
- **Reason**: Structural scoping can't be forgotten (no cross-plan leak); switching plans needs no re-login.
- **Trade-off**: All scoped routes nested under the plan prefix; frontend query keys include the active plan.
- **Scope**: `ApiRoutes`, controllers, frontend service hooks.
- **Date**: 2026-07-12
- **Status**: active

### AD-006
- **Decision**: Deleting a plan is a soft delete (`plans.deleted_at`); dependent rows are never cascaded. Archived plans are filtered by explicit per-finder `deleted_at IS NULL`, not a global `@SQLRestriction` (which would break `membership.getPlan()` loads).
- **Reason**: A hard cascade delete was too risky; soft delete is reversible and keeps history.
- **Trade-off**: Archived rows accumulate until a purge exists (ROADMAP M4-07).
- **Scope**: Plan lifecycle, every plan read path.
- **Date**: 2026-07-12
- **Status**: active

### AD-007
- **Decision**: Line items (`TransactionItem`) are an additive child of a transaction, each with its own category; the category breakdown follows a partition invariant `spent[C] = A[C] − B[C] + I[C]` (uncategorized items and the un-itemized remainder stay on the parent category), computed in the pure `CategoryBreakdownAssembler`. Sums are loose (`0 ≤ Σitems ≤ amount`).
- **Reason**: "Cleaning vs. food inside one grocery run" needs the item to be the unit of category truth; loose sums avoid forcing full itemization.
- **Trade-off**: The category-keyed dashboard query and limit evaluation became item-aware; top-line totals never move.
- **Scope**: Transactions, dashboard category breakdown and limits.
- **Date**: 2026-07-15
- **Status**: active

### AD-008
- **Decision**: Category spend is computed per category × member from participation shares. A line item's amount is attributed to the transaction's participants in proportion to their shares, allocated in integer cents by the largest remainder method. Category settings tied to a member (per-member limits, ownership) are kept dormant when that member leaves the plan, never deleted, and apply again on rejoin.
- **Reason**: Per-member limits and owned categories need a member axis on the item-aware breakdown; penny-exact allocation keeps Σ members == category total; keeping member data matches how transactions already survive removal.
- **Trade-off**: Items cannot be assigned to one member explicitly; the proportional rule is provisional (IDEAS "Item-level splits").
- **Scope**: Category breakdown (dashboard + Categories tab), category limits, plan membership.
- **Date**: 2026-10-12
- **Status**: active

### AD-009
- **Decision**: Sessions are a 15-minute bearer JWT held in memory plus a rotating, SHA-256-hashed session token in `user_sessions`, delivered only in an `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict` cookie scoped to `/api/findraco/auth`. Every other route keeps `Authorization: Bearer`. Revocation deletes rows; a session token replayed more than 30 s after rotation deletes its device chain.
- **Reason**: Expired sessions rendered empty pages and the 24h JWT forced a daily sign-in; the user wants 30-day sliding sessions with real sign-out and reset-revokes-all, which a stateless token cannot give. Chosen over a server-side cookie session to keep the bearer API, tests and Swagger unchanged.
- **Trade-off**: A session table and a renewal flow in the SPA; revocation reaches already-issued access tokens only after their 15 minutes.
- **Scope**: Authentication (backend `security/`, `SessionService`, frontend `findracoApi`, `AuthProvider`, `PrivateRoute`).

## Handoff

- **Feature**: M5-08 Session persistence (`.specs/features/session-persistence/`). Built on branch `feat/session-persistence` (not pushed, not merged). Verifier **PASS** at iteration 3 (`validation.md`, `validate_state` exit 0); `./mvnw verify` green and IT mutants I1–I10 killed
- **Phase / Task**: Execute done — T1–T14 + fixes F1–F6. Spec amended 2026-10-16 (Expired AC 4 narrowed; AC 9 silent expiry on public pages; AC 10 one message when a request fails on expiry)
- **Completed**: spec, discuss (no "remember me"), design (approach A, AD-009), tasks, implementation, 3 verification iterations. Frontend 356 tests; backend `./mvnw verify` 118 unit + 176 IT green
- **In-progress** (file:line): none
- **Next step**: (1) Merge to `main` and deploy backend + frontend **together** (backend alone = 15-minute sessions with no renewal); every user signs in once after deploy. (2) UAT in prod. Before that, previous Next step still stands: second UX round for categories, then M5-05 MCP connector, M5-07 PWA
- **Runtime state**: API runs detached (`setsid nohup ./mvnw spring-boot:run`), log `backend/target/api.log`; stop with `pgrep -f spring-boot:run | xargs kill`. Vite dev server on :5173. DB via SSH tunnel `ssh -N -L 5432:localhost:5432 vps` (brought up again on 2026-10-16). `./mvnw verify` empties `dev_finsight`. If Safari in dev drops the session cookie over `http://localhost`, set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=false` in `backend/.env`
- **Blockers**: none for this feature (merge and deploy wait on the user's go-ahead). `npm run lint` fails with 23 pre-existing storybook/table errors; branch adds none
- **Uncommitted files**: none
- **Branch**: feat/session-persistence (main untouched since `f2a31f7`)
